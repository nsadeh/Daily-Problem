This repo contains Python 3.6 solutions to some of the Daily Coding Problem when I manage to get to them. All solution are of my own design and programming, but of course I do not own any of the problems.

## List of Problems Solved

__1. Problem #27: Well-Formed Brackets__

This problem was asked by Facebook.

Given a string of round, curly, and square open and closing brackets, return whether the brackets are balanced (well-formed).

For example, given the string "([])[]({})", you should return true.

Given the string "([)]" or "((()", you should return false.

The solution is available [here](https://github.com/nsadeh/Daily-Problem/blob/master/problem_27.py).
